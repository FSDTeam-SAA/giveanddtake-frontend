            If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it
            unenforceable, Members and Elevator Video Pitch agree that the court
            should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still
            achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree
            to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce
            the rest of this Contract.
